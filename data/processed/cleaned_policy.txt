Where the employee is not conversant in English, it shall be provided for in vernacular. The Charge Memorandum may be issued by the Registrar of the Institute; the Dean of respective schools or such other officer as may be duly authorized. c. When Charges are admitted:- The condition precedent to the exercise of power of dispensing with the services of an employee on the ground of misconduct, is holding of enquiry for the purpose of establishing the misconduct by recording evidence at an enquiry. When Law requires that a particular thing should be done in a particular manner it impliedly prohibits the doing of the same in any other manner. Hence, despite admission of guilt, the enquiry has to be conducted and completed as more fully contained herein. d. When charges are not admitted:- On receipt of the Charge Memo, when the reply of the Delinquent is found unsatisfactory and the employee is to be punished, Enquiry should be conducted and such decision shall be informed to the employee in writing.
